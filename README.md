# 🛒 Billing Item CRUD Application – Python

A simple and efficient **Billing & Inventory Management** project that performs **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on store items. This app helps small shops or businesses manage products, update stock, and generate bills easily using pure Python. No fancy frameworks—just straightforward code that gets the job done.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Add New Item** (Create): Quick entry for products with name, price, and quantity.
- **View All Items** (Read): Display inventory in a clean table format.
- **Update Item Details** (Update): Edit existing items on the fly.
- **Delete Items** (Delete): Remove stuff you don't need anymore.
- **Auto Bill Generation**: Pick items, add quantities, calculate subtotal + tax, and print a bill to console (easy to extend for files).
- **Data Persistence**: Stores everything in a SQLite database (`billing_items.db`)—no JSON hassle, but it's lightweight and works offline.
- **User-friendly Menu Interface**: Console-based, with screen clears and pauses for that retro feel.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** (tested on 3.12+)
- **SQLite** for database storage (built-in, no installs needed)
- **Modular Functions** for clean CRUD logic
- **datetime** for bill timestamps
- No external libs—keeps it beginner-friendly and portable.

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **Launch the App**: Fire up `main.py` and pick from the menu.
2. **CRUD Ops**:
   - Add a product? Enter name, price, qty—total auto-calcs.
   - View list? See a formatted table with IDs, names, prices, qtys, and totals.
   - Update? Select by ID, tweak details.
   - Delete? Bye-bye item.
3. **Billing Module**:
   - Select items from inventory.
   - Specify quantities (respects stock limits).
   - Calculates: Item totals → Subtotal → 10% Tax → Grand Total.
   - Prints a nice invoice with date/time.

Data sticks around between runs thanks to SQLite. No servers, no sweat.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Install Python 3**: Grab it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it (3.8+ works fine).
2. **Clone or Download**: 
   - Save `main.py` to a folder (e.g., `billing_crud`).
   - No Git? Just copy-paste the code into a file.
3. **Run It**:
   ```
   cd billing_crud
   python main.py
   ```
   Boom—DB auto-sets up. Add some items and bill away!

**Pro Tip**: On Windows, might need `py` instead of `python`. Tested on Linux/Mac too.
